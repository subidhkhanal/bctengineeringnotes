Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything :- Very Hard Days to pass [7 Days Before Exam + 4 Days Mid Semester Study]
Goal - Score Above 45 /80 in the finals [Aim high if difficult question comes you can pass]

The subject is 95% Numerical .This subject be finished for about 45-50 marks mid semester. There are limited theory [5 % ] don't expect to pass by studying just theory. It's impossible.

This exam is the first exam of the semester so start a week ahead in advance try to finish 2 days before exam. You will certainly miss the mark and finish in the evening of the day before.

It will take you 1 and half day after sitting down to study to just start studying.

Numerical & Theory
Finish The Tutorial Question Listed below and old question collection numericals.

As Numerical are connected with theory so see the theory carefully and practice the numerical carefully. Finish Numerical First.

Watch The YouTube Videos First Then Only go to the notes as it will help you to get a overview of how to solve.
