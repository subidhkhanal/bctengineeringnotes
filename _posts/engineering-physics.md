This is Not A Subject To Start During Exam Time or Even In Assessment, Finish It Before Assessment
and use Assessment For Revision.

Total Days If complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything - 7 Days

If You have Never Started Reading Physics it will take you at Normal 7 days to understand the subject and its individual topics. It will take you 2 days for revision and aim to revise the subject 3 times before exam.

First Watch The YouTube Videos for concepts, Underlying Logic and background and only then see The List Of Important Theory Topics then after proceed to Notes. Directly Starting At Notes Is A Mistake that will cost you time and energy and even maybe Exams.

I would recommend you strongly Buy System Inception Physics Solution In Addition To The Book That College Provides because If There is Numerical Solutions and Theory Are Written So It Is Easy to Remember to give Exams. I would say don't buy The G.L Book House Book and another book called Refresher Manual On Engineering because they are shit worth less than Dog Shit.
If you have problems with Numerical there are Excellent Materials On Pulchowk Stationary Go and Look at Them and If Interested Buy Them.
