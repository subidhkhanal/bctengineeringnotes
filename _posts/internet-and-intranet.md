## Tips & Tricks

Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything:- 5.5 Days. [3 days before exam month and 2.5 days of exam month]
Goal - Score More than 55/80 Marks in final exam

Chapter 5 Numerical [1 Day] [Finish Before Exam Month] [Numerical are like Computer Network with little addition] Chapter 2,3,7 [Finish Before Exam Month] [1 Day]
Chapter 1,5 [1st Day Evening + Morning of 2nd Day]
Chapter 2,3,7 [2nd Day]
Chapter 4,6 [3rd day] [For Error Margin Or Rest]
Start from 5 O clock the day before the exam for the revision [3 times finish]

To Pass with Ok marks is not hard. If you start in exam time to get good marks I would recommend you watch all the YouTube Videos at least twice before exam month and also finish Chapter 5 Numerical we have got you covered here completely here which will take you only two days + 1 Day. This is the second hardest day of the 8th semester, which sounds hard but is not that hard. It is like other normal subjects you have studied in the semester, so don't worry.

While the Handwritten notes given here are good, I would strongly recommend buying The System Inception Internet and Intranet book as it contains notes and Old Question Numerical question solutions in detail. The Pulchowk note is complete Garbage, so don't buy it.

The Way To Read Is With YouTube Videos and Notes. To Revise is with notes and a list of Important Topics and YouTube Videos at 1.25X Speed.
