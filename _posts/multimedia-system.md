## Tips & Tricks

Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything:- 2 Very Chill Days[0 Days Before Exam Months]. Goal - Scoring Above 65/80 on the board

Aim To Start 1st day evening or Compulsory second day morning Revision Will Be Finished If Start The At 5 in the Evening 1 Day Before the exam then You Wake Up At five till 11:30 [3 times minimum]

This is an easy subject to study and has around 12 or13 main questions that are very easy to understand and remember.

As these topics are very easy-to-understand conceptual topics, I would recommend YouTube Videos to understand the Individual Topics in the exam & the videos can be finished in 1.5 days. But while watching the YouTube videos, I recommend you keep the book in front of you as the videos exactly don't match the theory like in other subjects.

While revising, follow the old question or Important Question List closely, as the note contains many topics that are not asked frequently.

A Good Way To Revise It Is To See The Note With Old Question Solution And Then See The YouTube Video If Confused Full note with old question solution[Definite Guide] Old questions
Multimedia System Important Topics [Extremely Recommended]

The Good Note with chapter-wise old question solution is after page 43, so directly jump to that. LZW Decompression was asked for the first time in 8 marks in 2077 Chaitra So Add One More Important Topic

YouTube Videos [Extremely Recommended]
Chapter 3 - Image And Graphics [Little Hard]
Everything Else - All Chapters Except 3

Chapter-wise Notes [See only If Curious]
Chapter 1 - Introduction
Chapter 2 - Sound / Audio System Chapter 3 - Images and Graphics
Chapter 4 - Video and Animation
Chapter 5 - Data Compression
Chapter 6 - User Interfaces + Remaining
Chapter 7 - Abstractions for programming
Chapter 8 - Multimedia Application

The Marks Distribution Is almost useless in this subject. Just see the important question list and old questions.
