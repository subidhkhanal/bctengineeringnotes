Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything :- 6 Days. [3.5 days before exam month and 2.5 days of exam month]
Goal - Score More than 60/80 Marks in final exam
Chapter 4 Numerical + Chapter 8 Numerical [1 Day] [Finish Thoroughly Before Exam Month]
Chapter 1,5,8 [1.5 Day] [Finish Before Exam Month] [Finish Them and remember the Header(Ch. 5) And Algorithm(Ch. 8) ]
Chapter 2,3,4,6,7 [Just Watch The YouTube Videos Thoroughly No Worries] [1 Days]
At Exam Month
Chapter 1,4 [1st Day Evening + 2nd Day Morning]
Chapter 2,3,5 [2nd Day] [Easy + Easy + Hard]
Chapter 6,7,8 [3rd Day] [Easy + Easy + Hard]

To guarantee to pass, starting at the exam month is not a sure way like other subjects. The chapters with most marks are hard and you always run into the probability that from the chapters you have studied hard questions or unexpected question come.

Concerning the theory the notes are enough and also for the Numerical of chapter 8 can be easily understood from the note. Chapter 4 Numerical will take little time and be sure to see converting IP to binary and if you look at 3 or 4 questions the numerical will be clear to you. For Chapter 4 Numerical or note both the Anku Jaiswal Note or Old Question Solution Should be fine.
