Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything :- 3.5 Days. [1 day before exam month and 2.5 days of exam month]  
Goal - Score More than 65/80 Marks in final exam.

Before Exam watch the YouTube Videos [Extremely Easy] [1 Day]
Again watch all the YouTube Videos [1st Day Evening + 2nd Day until 3 O Clock] Then open the Pulchowk note and start remembering things you need to remember and when confused watch the YouTube videos. [Chill Revision]

The problem is that the words of the note doesn't exactly match with the YouTube Videos and some topics are explained in a difficult way in the notes.

The subject is super easy but the problem in trying to achieve more than 65 is that all the topics listed in the syllabus is important.

There is no use in trying to make a list of Important Topics The Only Notes Available are in the book of the college but as there is only one or two teachers [Most Probably One] in the Entire IOE his notes are found in Pulchowk college stationary so you can go and buy it from there. But keep in mind it doesn't contain the last chapter so you should find it from somewhere.

There is no notes available Online and the only old question is in the IOE Syllabus app but as already mentioned above it is of no use as everything is important.
