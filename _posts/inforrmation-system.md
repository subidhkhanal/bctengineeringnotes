## Tips & Tricks

Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything:- 4 Days. [1 day before exam month and 2.5 days of exam month] Goal - Score More than 55/80 Marks in the final exam

Chapter 1,2 [1st Day] [Start at Evening at 5 O Clock]
Chapter 3,4,5,6,7,8 [2nd Day + Morning of 3rd Day]
[5,6 Very Easy] Start from 3 O clock and at last 5 O clock the day before the exam for the revision [3 times finish]

To Pass with Ok marks is not hard if you start in exam time to get good marks. I recommend watching all the YouTube Videos at least once before exam month, and we have covered you completely here, which will take you only one day.

It is an easy subject, not as easy as Big Data which is ridiculously easy, but easy compared to the other subjects you have already read. There are no numerical in this subject but only theory.

While the Full notes given here are good, I would strongly recommend buying The System Inception Information System book as it contains notes and Important question solutions. The Pulchowk note here is very, very bad so don't buy it.

The Way To Read Is With YouTube Videos and Revise is with notes and a list of Important Topics and YouTube Videos at 1.25X Speed
