## Tips & Tricks

Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything:- 4.5 Days [1.5 Days Before Exam Month + 2.5 Days In Exam Months]
Goal - Score More than 55/80 in Final Exam

Start Numerical of Markov Chain First [.5 Days] [YouTube video available]
Then the Numerical for random number tests [1 Day] [Looks hard until you start] [No YouTube Video Available] [Aim to finish Numerical Before the Exam month starts].

The theory will take 1.5 days as there are some difficult topics, and you must remember some algorithms. 1 Day for revision and .5 for rest or error margin.

Starting on the second Day in the morning will be enough if already finished Numerical. The revision will take one Day, and aim to begin revision at 3 Pm and at last 5 Pm and wake up at 5 Am.

This is not a hard subject, but it is the hardest subject of the 8th semester. It contains four types of numerical. Markov Chain and three kinds of tests [Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Poker Test, And Chi-Square Test].

But the numerical is very lacking in this category, and there are good notes online as of writing this, but it is not good enough to solve all your doubts first. So see it repeatedly to be clear. There are no good resources other than what I have found. The year-wise collection of numerical is given below.

The Only Way To Revise Is With Notes No Videos Here My Dear Friend
