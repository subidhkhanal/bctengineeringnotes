Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything :- 4 Days. [1 day before exam month and 2.5 days of exam month]
Goal - Score More than 55/80 Marks in final exam

Chapter 1,2 [1st Day] [Start at Evening at 5 O Clock]
Chapter 3,4,5,6,7,8 [2nd Day + Morning of 3rd Day] [5,6 Very Easy]
Start form 3 O clock and at last 5 O clock the day before exam for the revision [3 times finish]

To Pass with Ok marks is not hard if you just start in exam time to get good marks. I would recommend you to just watch all the YouTube Videos at least once before exam month and we have got you covered here completely here which will take you only one day.

It is a easy subject not as easy like Big Data which is ridiculously easy but easy compared to the other subjects that you have already read. There are no numerical in this subject but only theory.
