## Tips & Tricks

Total Days If Complete Newbie and Never Started, Don't Know Anything :- 2 Very Chill Days [0 Days Before Exam]
Goal - Score Above 65/80 in the finals

As these topics are very easy to understand conceptual topics and don't have a lot of detail in them I so finish YouTube Videos and finish all the chapters in the 2nd day.

Again See The Book in the third day with the YouTube Videos again, You need to see what to write in the Exam .
Revision Will Be Finished If You Wake Up At 5 till 11:30 [3 times]

This Is A Very Very Easy Subject To Study. This is the Easiest Subject Ever. It has around 7or 8 main question and 5 small questions which are very easy to understand and remember.

After watching Videos see the photos 1,2,3 and then open the book and know what to write about each topic in detail.
A very good way to revise before exam would be to play the YouTube Videos at 1.25X-1.5X speed and then watch notes.
